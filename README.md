# Git With It Or Git Lost
Bash alias that gives git newbies 3 commands to instruct them to create/push/clone and one command to list the 3 commands
During the first week of class I made a list of git commands to help some fellow students, I've now written them into bash aliases to make it easier. 

COPY AND PASTE CODE INTO ~/.bash_profile
TYPE IN got_lost for rest of commands

TO DO:

Figure out how to make it a script so beginners don't have to use .bash_profile

Figure out how to replace underscores with spaces

Figure out how to make a better README
